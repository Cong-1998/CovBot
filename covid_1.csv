Question,Answer
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading  COVID-19 to people. The risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. To protect yourself such as when visiting live animal markets avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals."
"Can coronavirus spread through water, like in a swimming pool or hot tub?","There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools and hot tubs. But health officials still advise staying at least 6 feet away from others because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. In other words, you probably won’t get coronavirus from the water, but you could get coronavirus from someone close to you in the water."
Can coronavirus stick to clothes? ,Coronavirus can stay alive for up to three days on stainless steel and plastic but not clothing.
Can COVID-19 be transmitted through food?,There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed at temperatures similar to that of other known viruses and bacteria found in food.
Can the coronavirus disease be transmitted in hot or humid climates?,"From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth and nose."
Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?,"At this time, no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person."
Can COVID-19 spread through treated drinking water?,"Currently, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people by drinking treated water. Water treatment plants use filters and disinfectants to remove or kill germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 is spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. So, you can continue to use and drink water from your tap as usual."
What is community spread?,"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s website.​"
Can I get COVID-19 from my pets?,"Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of pets spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets such as wash your hands after handling animals, their food, waste, or supplies and practice good pet hygiene."
Can I leave home?,All people are required to stay home unless it is necessary to go outside. And wear a mask when going outside.
Should I wear a face mask?,You need to wear a mask at this time. Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives. Masks reduce potential exposure risk from an infected person whether they have symptoms or not. People wearing masks are protected from getting infected. Masks also prevent onward transmission when worn by a person who is infected.
Who is at a higher risk to get infected with COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is often more severe in people who are older than 60 years or who have health conditions like lung or heart disease, diabetes or conditions that affect their immune system.​"
Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time?,"It is important to continue taking care of your health and wellness. Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has told you."
"Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages or products?","There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."
Is it okay for me to donate blood?,"Currently there is no data or evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted by blood transfusion. Blood donation agencies are committed to the highest standard of safety and infection control to keep healthy donors just that – healthy. Even in areas that have been issued stay-at-home or shelter in place orders, you can still leave your home to go donate blood."
Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?,"Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?,"Stay home for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19. Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19. If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, or sore throat.

Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?,"COVID-19 symptoms can sometimes persist for months. The virus can damage the lungs, heart and brain, which increases the risk of long-term health problems. Most people who have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recover completely within a few weeks"
How long does it take to develop symptoms?,"Symptoms for COVID-19 can start as early as 2 days and as long as 14 days after you are exposed. Research shows that the average time symptoms appear is around 4 to 5 days. For many people, these symptoms initially are mild and then worsen over a few days. The most common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath."
Is it possible to have the flu and COVID-19 at the same time?,"Yes. It is possible to test positive for flu (as well as other respiratory infections) and COVID-19 at the same time. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis."

"I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test could I take?","Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection in the past, even if they have not had symptoms. Also known as serological tests and usually done on a blood sample, these tests detect antibodies produced in response to an infection. In most people, antibodies start to develop after days to weeks and can indicate if a person has had past infection. Antibody tests cannot be used to diagnose COVID-19 in the early stages of infection or disease but can indicate whether or not someone has had the disease in the past."
What are the steps taken during the procedure of covid-19 testing in Malaysia?,"Firstly, you will need to fill in forms to provide ample details to the centre. Next, nasopharyngeal swab will be done by inserting a 6th-inches cotton through the nostrils and throat. Sometimes, nasopharyngeal wash or aspirate, sputum, or tracheal aspiration may be taken too. The samples will be stored appropriately and will be tested within 24 to 72 hours. The results will be informed as soon as it has been yielded."

What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. However, children with certain underlying medical conditions and infants (less than 1 year old) might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)."
Should children wear masks?,"In general, children 2 years and older should wear a mask. Masks offer some protection to your children and are also meant to protect those around children, in case children are unknowingly infected with the virus that causes COVID-19."
How are babies affected by COVID-19?,"Although rare, children under age 1 appear to be at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19 than older children. This is likely due to their immature immune systems and smaller airways, which make them more likely to develop breathing issues with respiratory virus infections."
What is MIS-C?,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. We do not yet know what causes MIS-C. However, we know that many children with MIS-C had the virus that causes COVID-19, or had been around someone with COVID-19. MIS-C can be serious, even deadly, but most children who were diagnosed with this condition have gotten better with medical care."
what is close contact?,"Any individual within 1 metre of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more, from 2 days before to 14 days after the case's onset of illness."
Am I considered a close contact if I was wearing a mask,"Yes, you are still considered a close contact even if you were wearing a mask while you were around someone with COVID-19."
What is contact tracing?,Contact tracing is allow people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Helping people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 get tested. Asking people to self-isolate if they have COVID-19 or self-quarantine if they are a close contact of someone with COVID-19.
"if i am a close contact, will i be tested for covid-19","If you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should be tested, even if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19. All the close contacts required to home quarantine for daily surveillance for 14 days."
Who needs to self quarantine?,"Individual who close contacts will be tested and required to home quarantine for daily surveillance for 14 days.

what is HSO?,"HSO is Home Surveillance Order. HSO will be given to individuals who have mild symptoms and do not meet the criteria for admission to the ward, namely Patient Under Investigation (PUI), in addition to individuals who are not symptomatic, but have a history related to epidemiology such as close contact to cases infected with Covid-19, Persons Under Surveillance (PUS)."
What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?,Isolation keeps an infected person with the virus away from others until he tests negative and is no longer infectious. Quarantine keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others for a sufficiently long period during which he may develop symptoms or until his repeat tests show he is not infected.
Can I use hand sanitizer on pets?,"Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners.

If your pet ingests hand sanitizer (such as by chewing the bottle) or is showing signs of illness after use, contact your veterinarian or pet poison control immediately."
What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it's COVID-19?,"If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care. Routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time."
can animals carry covid-19 on their skin or fur?,"Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets."
What is MERS?,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a severe, acute respiratory illness caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV infection was first reported in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia, but an outbreak in April 2012 in Jordan was confirmed retrospectively."
What is SARS?,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a severe, acute respiratory illness caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS is much more severe than other coronavirus infections. SARS is an influenza-like illness that occasionally leads to progressively severe respiratory insufficiency. SARS-CoV was first detected in the Guangdong province of China in November 2002."
Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?,"Yes. Malaysia granted conditional approval for the use of coronavirus vaccines produced by US Pfizer-BioNTech, UK firm AstraZeneca, China Sinovac, China CanSino Biologics, US Johnson & Johnson and Russia Sputnik V."
Is The COVID-19 Vaccine Safe For Everyone?,"While the COVID-19 vaccine should be safe for most people, there are certain groups of people who should not get the vaccine due to age and health concerns. This includes children (due to the lack of clinical testing done on individuals below the age of 16) and individuals who have had a tendency for allergic reactions to any vaccine or injectable medication."
How Will The Vaccine Be Taken?,"Most of the currently-available vaccines have to be taken in two shots (a priming dose followed by a booster shot) to be effective. These two shots will be administered weeks apart - the actual duration depends on which vaccine you'll be taking. Once you've gotten the vaccine shot, it will typically take a few weeks for your body to build immunity and protection against the COVID-19 virus."
How Much Will The Vaccine Cost?,"The cost of the vaccine in Malaysia is reported to be RM77.35. However, it has been announced that it will be given free to Malaysians (foreigners may have to pay a fee determined by the Ministry of Health)."

The vaccine shots will be voluntary once they become available, and Malaysians will get the option to sign up to get vaccinated via an app feature that will be rolled out on MySejahtera in the near future."
Are There Side Effects From Taking The Vaccine?,"Common side effects reported from those who have already taken the vaccine are fatigue, headache, muscle aches, chills, redness, swelling or pain around injection site."
Am I 100% Safe From COVID-19 Once I Get The Vaccine?,"No, you are not. Individuals who have obtained the COVID-19 vaccine may still be susceptible to the virus. A vaccine with a 95% effectiveness rate essentially means that the shot may not be effective in protecting about 1 out of 20 people from getting ill."
"If I Had COVID-19, Do I Still Need To Get The Vaccine?","Yes, even those who have recovered from the COVID-19 are recommended to still get vaccinated as it has been found that COVID-19 re-infection is possible even after you've recovered from it."
